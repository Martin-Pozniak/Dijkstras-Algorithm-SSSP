This directory contains all the files to run the program.

To run the file open visual studio and load in the .sln file in the SSSP folder. Navigate to the program.class file and run it. You may need to build the microsoft excel object references into the project if they are not already included.

IMPORTANT: change the PATH_TO_SOURCE Member variable in the main program class to the path to the DATA-FINAL-REMADE.xlsx file on your file system.

The program.cs file included in this directory is NOT the file that is used by the .sln file. It is in this directory for simple access to it to inspect the code.
